        Write a program named <code>discussion.cpp</code> in which
        process <var>p</var> sends a message to process (<var>p</var> + 1)
        % <var>N</var>, where <var>N</var> is the number of processes.  (The
        message can be whatever you want.)  After <em>receiving</em> its
        message, each process should print &ldquo;<code>Process <var>p</var>
        received a message from process <var>q</var></code>,&rdquo;
        where <var>p</var> is the id of the process and <var>q</var> is the id
        of the process that sent the message.
        <p>
          Things to think about:
        </p>
        <ul class="half-spaced">
          <li>Should a process try to send its message first, or recieve
            first?</li>
          <li>What would happen if every process tried to receive (or send)
            at the same time?</li>
          <li>How are the edge processes (i.e., 0 and <var>N</var>-1
            where <var>N</var> is the number of processes) different?</li>
          <li>What happens when the program is run in only one process?</li>
          <li>
            How can you maximize the amount of parallelism in this program?
            That is, how can you have the greatest number of processes running
            at the same time?
          </li>

        In image processing, a <dfn>blur</dfn> effect can be created by
        changing each pixel to be the average of itself and the pixels around
        it.  We are going to blur an array of numbers in a similar way: each
        number in the array will be replaced with the average of itself and
        its surrounding numbers.
        <p>
          In order to limit the blurring effect, each number should be
          weighted twice as heavily as the numbers surrounding it (e.g., count
          it twice).  For example, suppose we have the following list of numbers:
        </p>
        <pre>
4
7
2
5
</pre>
        <p>
          Blurring should give the following result:
        </p>
        <pre>
(    4 + 4 + 7) / 3 = 5
(4 + 7 + 7 + 2) / 4 = 5
(7 + 2 + 2 + 5) / 4 = 4
(2 + 5 + 5    ) / 3 = 4
</pre>
        <p>
          Notice that each number is counted twice in calculating its average.
          Also notice that the first and last numbers are the average of 3
          numbers, not 4, because they are missing a surrounding number
        </p>
        <p>
          Write a program named <code>blur.cpp</code>.
        </p>
        <ul class="half-spaced">
          <li>
            You must use double-precision floating point numbers
            (i.e., <code>double</code>).  Note that the
            constant <code>MPI_DOUBLE</code> is used to tell MPI you are
            sending <code>double</code>s.
          </li>
          <li>Start by letting the user enter <var>N</var> numbers,
            where <var>N</var> is the number of processes.</li>
          <li>
            Process 0 should send each other process its number, plus the one
            before and after it.  (Except the last process which will only
            have a number before, not after it.)
            <div>
              It is encouraged, though not required, that you store your
              numbers in a vector and and send all three numbers in a single
              call to <code>MPI_Send</code>; i.e., &ldquo;send three doubles
              starting <em>here</em>.&rdquo;
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Each process should calculate a new value for its number as the
            average of itself and the numbers surrounding it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each other process should send its new number back to process 0.
          </li>
          <li>
            Process 0 should print out all the numbers in order.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Create at least three different test cases, each consisting of an
          input/output file pair.  When the program is run with the input in
          the input file, it should generate the output in the output file.
          The first test case should use 4 processes; the other two should use
          64 processes.  <em>Your first test case should be different than the one
          shown above.</em>  Put some thought into the different scenarios you
          should test for.
